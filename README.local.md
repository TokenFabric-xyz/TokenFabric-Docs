Certainly! I'd be happy to help rewrite the introduction.mdx page for TokenFabric. Before I do that, I have a few questions to ensure I capture the essence of your protocol accurately:
What is the main purpose of TokenFabric?
What are the key features or advantages of using TokenFabric?
Who is the target audience for TokenFabric (e.g., developers, investors, businesses)?
Are there any specific blockchain networks that TokenFabric supports?
Does TokenFabric have any unique selling points or innovations that set it apart from other similar protocols?
Once you provide this information, I'll be able to craft a compelling introduction for TokenFabric.


1. the main purpose of token fabric is to allow everyone, user creator entreprener artist etc to have tools to realise their ideas by creating digital assets with no code or knowledge structuring their ideas. it can take form of cryptomonnaine (erc20) or nft (erc1155), and be immediatly tradable with an automated market maker rule by a bonding curve on smart contract. The easy tokenomics definitions and the royalties can give multiple possibilities. 
Beside easily creating, we want to ease the process of token discovery and community contribution through our fundation that provide other protocol which integrate token fabric to give those created assets furthermore features in additionnal ecosystem ! 

2. heres the key features of token fabric : 
- easily create digital assets with multiples forms (erc20 or erc1155)
- define tokenomic with guide through our dApp (free mint which mint token to the creator out of the bonding curve)
- define royalties and mecanisms or buy back / burn / budget automation etc
- assets instantly tradable with a bonding curve defining the pricing 
- create assets lock for transparant and easy allocation 
- no knowledge required, pay by card and/or crypto, instant swap and bridge, user can create wallet on the dApp with an email or use their own wallet like metamask or coinbase wallet or more than 200 wallets
- smart contracts secured by erc2523 diamond pattern offering upgradeability and code optimization / security
- features to manage assets (multiple transfer of assets in one transactions, dashboard with metrics, marketing page etc) 

3. the target audience is potentially all creator, entreprener, artiste, everyone with an idea willing to communicate, bring people together around a concrete plan, or raise funds for their project through innovative and accessible way, 
user that will buy thoses tokens are potentially everyone, since thoses digital assets represent potentially everything. All public may be able to buy thoses token, even with no web3 knowledge since its possible to pay by card instantly with an email created wallet.

4. Token Fabric is actually deployed on Ethereum and Base mainnet, and soon on all EVM network to ease the accessibility with a native bridge for all token created on the protocol 

5. Our unique offer lies in our infinite and easy tokenomic definition through our multiples bonding curve models, royatlies definition and redirection, locks and others allocations and managements features, as our native bridge feature allowing every token created on our plateform to be bridged on others supported chain with  a custom integration of chainlink CCIP 


Dont hesitate to reformulate my words to have a professional and concice description (no buzz words, keep it serious and professional)





Certainly! I'll create the asset-creation.mdx page for TokenFabric protocol. Before I start writing, I'd like to ask a few questions to ensure I cover all the necessary information:
Are there any specific features or advantages of creating digital assets through TokenFabric that should be highlighted?
Does TokenFabric offer any unique customization options for ERC20 tokens or ERC1155 NFTs?
Are there any limitations or restrictions on the types of assets that can be created using TokenFabric?
Does TokenFabric provide any tools or guidance for users to determine which token standard (ERC20 or ERC1155) is best for their specific use case?
Are there any real-world examples or success stories of assets created using TokenFabric that we can mention?
Once you provide this information, I'll be able to create a comprehensive and accurate asset-creation.mdx page for TokenFabric.
1. beside those key feature of token fabric : 

- easily create digital assets with multiples forms (erc20 or erc1155)
- define tokenomic with guide through our dApp (free mint which mint token to the creator out of the bonding curve)
- define royalties and mecanisms or buy back / burn / budget automation etc
- assets instantly tradable with a bonding curve defining the pricing 
- create assets lock for transparant and easy allocation 
- no knowledge required, pay by card and/or crypto, instant swap and bridge, user can create wallet on the dApp with an email or use their own wallet like metamask or coinbase wallet or more than 200 wallets
- smart contracts secured by erc2523 diamond pattern offering upgradeability and code optimization / security
- features to manage assets (multiple transfer of assets in one transactions, dashboard with metrics, marketing page etc) 



2. an other specific adventage of creating erc20 and erc1155 on token fabric its it native integration with the other protocol of the ecosystem, giving thoses assets different usage like dao governance, asset monetisation like onlyfan, digital entreprener etc

3. only erc20 and erc1155 can be created, and the legal status of the asset is to be handle by the creator

4. the point of this page is to help user chose between erc20 and erc1155 and understanding the difference

5. the digital entreprener created with Zenvest show how an erc20 token launched on token fabric is used to generate revenue, and as governance right in a decentralized community owned by its member


Certainly! I'll create the customizable-tokenomics.mdx file for TokenFabric documentation. Before I start, I'd like to ask a few questions to ensure I cover the most relevant information:
What are the main tokenomics mechanisms that TokenFabric offers?
Are there any specific parameters that users can customize for their tokenomics?
How does TokenFabric's tokenomics design differ from traditional approaches?
Are there any limitations or best practices users should be aware of when designing their tokenomics?
Once you provide this information, I'll be able to create a comprehensive and coherent page that complements the other documentation without unnecessary repetition.

1. user can chose between multiple tokenomic model, for exemple a free mint may be designed by the creator to allocate tokens to teams, for the project, marketing, listing on dex etc, or all the supply may be allocated to the bonding curve, royalties may be set on buy and sell on the bonding curve to generate income that can be used in various way, like buy back, budget redirection, burn etc, also the model of the bonding curve may impact the tokenomic (flat, exponential, etc) 

2. heres different settings to set at token creation:
- User may chose at the time of creation a buy and sell royalties that will be immutable on the bonding curve
- this royalties may be splitted between 2 receiver address and the % of split may be changed by the builder of the token
- this royalties may be redirected to a burn address to increase the token value, to a dao to give power to the entity, or to the project to use those funds for growth. 
- builder chose between different bonding curve model (linear, exponential, flat, logarithmic) defining the price
- user chose a max supply for the token and a free minting supply (which is directly minted to its wallet / not backed by the bonding curve)
- builder chose an initial minting price and final minting price for the bonding curve
- builder can then (with free mint for exemple) create lock to allocate the token supply to teams, marketing etc 
- builder can setup its token presentation page to present its tokenomic and choice 

3. token fabric offer an all in one solution with clean explanation and step by step deployment, allowing a modular digital asset creation for any purpose with multiple feature that can be coupled with another ecosystem to extend with extra features

4. a tokenomic should be carefully designed with consideration and clear plan for its futur (reserving a part of the supply for dex for exemple, carefull price design, clear explanation for the community etc)



Certainly! I'd be happy to help you write the royalties.mdx page for TokenFabric documentation. Based on the information provided in the introduction.mdx file, I can create a comprehensive and professional page about royalties. However, to ensure I cover all the necessary aspects, I have a few questions:
Can you provide more details on the specific types of royalties that TokenFabric supports (e.g., buy royalties, sell royalties)?
Are there any limitations or best practices for setting royalty percentages?
Can you explain more about the "buy-back mechanisms" mentioned in the description?
How does the "budget automation" feature work in relation to royalties?
Are there any specific use cases or examples of how projects have successfully implemented royalties using TokenFabric?
Once you provide this additional information, I'll be able to create a comprehensive and informative royalties.mdx page for TokenFabric.
1. Tokenfabric allow builder to set at token creation a royalties for buy and an other for sell on tokens, which cannot be modified after token deployment, which can then be redirected to 2 distincts wallets (the % of split is chose by the builder and updatable)
2. best practice is to define the tokenomic and utility of the token to define royalties based on average fees of this kind of token (an artist may chose greater royalties on its nft than a liquid erc20 used for trading)
3. the buy back mecanism and budget automation are mecanisms that can be automated by the builder by redirecting the royalties received to specific use, like to the burn address, to a dao wallet, to a wallet that automaticly buy back token to increase value etc 
4. cf 3
5. Zenvest and the fundation use the royalties generated by their digital assets to provide revenue to their stake holders and constitute a recurring budget for dao 



Certainly! I'd be happy to help you write the locks.mdx page for TokenFabric documentation. Based on the information provided in the introduction.mdx and other pages, I'll create a comprehensive explanation of the lock mechanism. Before I start, I have a few questions to ensure I cover all the important aspects:
Can you provide more details on the types of locks available (e.g., time-based, vesting schedules, etc.)?
Are there any specific use cases or examples of how builders have used locks effectively?
Is there a limit to how many locks can be created for a single asset?
Can locks be modified or removed after they're set?
Are there any visual representations or diagrams that could be included to illustrate the lock mechanism?
Once you provide this information, I'll be able to create a more tailored and informative locks.mdx page for TokenFabric.
1. our actual only lock model is simple (more to come soon), user chose a time of unlocking, an amout to lock, and our contract deliver to the defined address the unlocked amount on receiver action at timestamp given 
2. Locks are commonly used with the free minting to allocate publicly token, or ensure big whale wont sell etc 
3. no limits on lock creation
4. once created, lock are imutable on the blockchain (contracts holds funds)
5. no visual only mdx representation 








could you help me write bridge.mdx page for token fabric documentation based on introduciton.mdx and others page ? 

this page should explain how we integrate a custom CCIP Arbitrary message implementation from chainlink natively in our protocol to allow builder to bridge and send their token to supported networks (feature in experimental atm)

dont hesitate to ask question 

Final Codebase Context
Certainly! I'd be happy to help you write the bridge.mdx page for TokenFabric documentation. Based on the information you've provided and the context from the introduction.mdx and other pages, I'll create a comprehensive explanation of the cross-chain bridge feature powered by Chainlink CCIP.
Before I start writing, I have a few questions to ensure I cover all the important aspects:
Which networks are currently supported for this bridging feature?
Are there any specific limitations or requirements for tokens to be eligible for bridging?
Can you provide more details on how the "Arbitrary message implementation" works in the context of TokenFabric?
Are there any fees associated with using the bridge?
How does the user experience differ when using this native bridge compared to traditional bridging solutions?
Once you provide this information, I'll be able to create a more tailored and informative bridge.mdx page for TokenFabric.
1. actually token fabric is deployed on ethereum and base, and we are testing the bridge between those 2 networks
2. during our alpa testing, a builder whiteliste might be setup, then it will goes permissionless
3. CCIP Arbitrary Messaging of chainlink :
Arbitrary Messaging: is the ability to send arbitrary data (encoded as bytes) to a receiving smart contract on a different blockchain. The developer is free to encode any data they wish to send. Typically, developers use arbitrary messaging to trigger an informed action on the receiving smart contract, such as rebalancing an index, minting a specific NFT, or calling an arbitrary function with the sent data as custom parameters. Developers can encode multiple instructions in a single message, enabling them to orchestrate complex, multi-step, multi-chain tasks.
4. a protocol and builder fees will be soon determined
5. the permissionless activation of thoses routes at token creation within few clics and the custom royalties earned by the builder, also the bridge is build with the token from our protocol in mind to preserve their supply and security across many networks 





ould you help me write bonding-curve.mdx page for token fabric documentation based on introduciton.mdx and others page ? 

this page should explain whats a bonding curve, how it works, why its ideal for trading compared to others system, whats the different models used by token fabric, whats the builder definition of thoses bonding curve models might affect the tokens and help them consider their bonding curve choice 

dont hesitate to ask question 

Final Codebase Context
Certainly! I'd be happy to help you write the bonding-curve.mdx page for TokenFabric documentation. Based on the information provided in the introduction.mdx and other pages, I'll create a comprehensive explanation of bonding curves and their implementation in TokenFabric. To ensure I cover all the important aspects, I have a few questions:
Can you provide more details on the specific bonding curve models offered by TokenFabric (e.g., linear, exponential, logarithmic, etc.)?
Are there any unique features or customizations that TokenFabric offers for bonding curves compared to traditional implementations?
Can you share any specific examples or use cases where different bonding curve models have been successfully applied within the TokenFabric ecosystem?
Are there any limitations or considerations that builders should be aware of when choosing a bonding curve model?
Once you provide this information, I'll be able to create a more tailored and informative bonding-curve.mdx page for TokenFabric.
1. the linear model is used for a more consistent progression, exponential increase the incentive for early investors easing the early stages, flat is used for stable coins and logaritmic is the reverse of exponential, 
2. builder by defining the initial price, final price, and total supply can customize the different model of bonding curve, and also provide custom supply / pricing schemas if desired
3. For gaming, DAO, artists, fundraisings etc
4. carefully designing the tokenomic and the utility of token 

Thank you for providing that additional information. I'll now create the bonding-curve.mdx page for TokenFabric documentation, incorporating these details. Here's the content for the page:

could you help me write asset-management.mdx page for token fabric documentation based on introduciton.mdx and others page ? 

this page should explain how builder and users can manage their assets through our features and dapp,
using locks, multiple assets transfers, managing royalties receiver wallet and dispatch, metrics on their dashboard, favorites tokens list, marketing throught the token details page presentation  

dont hesitate to ask question 

Final Codebase Context
Certainly! I'd be happy to help you write the asset-management.mdx page for TokenFabric documentation. Based on the information provided in the introduction.mdx and other pages, as well as the specific features you've mentioned, I'll create a comprehensive guide on asset management. Before I start writing, I have a few questions to ensure I cover all the important aspects:
Are there any specific limits on the number of assets that can be managed through the dApp?
Can you provide more details on the metrics available in the dashboard?
Are there any unique features in the token details page for marketing purposes?
How does the favorites tokens list work? Is it private to each user or can it be shared?
Once you provide this information, I'll be able to create a more tailored and informative asset-management.mdx page for TokenFabric.

1. no limits, the dApp is build for managing huge volume of tokens and transactions
2. dashboard will tracks all tokens created / favorited
3. the token details page allow the builder to define a main image, a banner image, a token description allowing to explain the tokenomics, allocation, purpose etc, and a clear display of all locks created 
4. the lists are currently private but soon will be potentially shared



could you help me write create-first-asset.mdx page for token fabric documentation based on introduciton.mdx and others page ? 

this page should explain how builder step by step can create their digital assets, with clear explanation 

dont hesitate to ask question 

Final Codebase Context
Certainly! I'd be happy to help you write the create-first-asset.mdx page for TokenFabric documentation. Based on the information provided in the introduction.mdx and other pages, I'll create a step-by-step guide for builders to create their digital assets. Before I start, I have a few questions to ensure I cover all the important aspects:
Are there any specific prerequisites (e.g., wallet setup, account creation) before a user can start creating an asset?
What are the main steps involved in the asset creation process?
Are there any key decisions that builders need to make during the creation process (e.g., choosing between ERC20 and ERC1155)?
Are there any best practices or tips you'd like to include for first-time asset creators?
Once you provide this information, I'll be able to create a more tailored and informative create-first-asset.mdx page for TokenFabric.
1. their is no specific prerequist since user can create a wallet in few clic with social login (email, google etc) if they dont have they own wallet - the social wallet can be exported anytime 
2. heres the steps :
1-> define your ideas, and tokens utility / form (erc20, erc1155), whats is purpose etc
2-> define a name and symbol and network of emission
3-> define buy and sell royalties, and 2 potential receiver address and the % split between those 2 address
4-> chose a bonding curve models - or a custom one
5->define the max supply, free mint, initial price and final price 
6-> launch ! instant trade, lock or transfer tokens

3. User should consider the use cases of their tokens, the tokenomics, the uses of royalties etc

4. look for other tokens in the same category of utility as they like to create, and looks for best practice in terms of tokenomics, fees, budgets usages, communication etc






could you help me write the explore-ecosystem.mdx based on the others pages of the tokenfabric documentation ? 

this page should present the global ecosystem, we have created a Foundation grouping 3 main actors, CodHash, Zenko, Quantum, each groups have multiple projects, for CodHash we have token fabric, zenvest, heko.club, Forgotten Yellow Duck, and others 

Each project of the ecosystem have product seamlessly integrated to work with synergie with the others projets. 
For exemple, builder may create a Digital entreprener or Muse by creating an erc20 tokens or erc1155, raising funds and community and then create RST on zenvest to share thoses revenues with zenvest tokenized equities etc

dont hesitate to ask me question, the page must be write in a professional, informative and engaging way with no buzzwords

Final Codebase Context
Thank you for providing the context and requirements for the explore-ecosystem.mdx page. I'll be happy to help you create a professional, informative, and engaging page that showcases the TokenFabric ecosystem. Before I start writing, I have a few questions to ensure I cover all the important aspects:
Can you provide a brief description of the Foundation and its role in the ecosystem?
Are there any specific synergies or integrations between projects that you'd like to highlight?
Are there any key benefits or unique features of the ecosystem that should be emphasized?
4. Do you have any specific examples or success stories of projects leveraging the ecosystem's synergies?
Is there any information about future plans or upcoming integrations within the ecosystem that should be mentioned?
Once you provide this additional information, I'll be able to create a comprehensive and tailored explore-ecosystem.mdx page for TokenFabric.
1. The Foundation is the central socle used to regroupe different entities and projects with one structure as free and maleable as possible. Each groups (entities with multiples projects) and entity or entreprener can join the Fondation if accepted by its participant to integrate its product to the global synergie. Each projects reverse revenue to the foundation allowing a reccurring budget dispatch to support specific action or projects. 
2. All projects are meant to interact with each others in a direct or indirect way. 
For exemple, builder may create a Digital entreprener or Muse by creating an erc20 tokens or erc1155, raising funds, strucutre and grow a community on Heko.Club (social graph with unique monnetization and digital assets extra features) and then create RST on zenvest to share thoses revenues with zenvest tokenized equities, structure a votation system etc
3. Our ecosystem in its globality allow anyone to achieve their ideas, by bringing and structuring people together, creating digital assets, raising funds and completing goals in a metrics, transparant, and distributed way. its a new way to build and structure people together.
4. Through the articulations of multiples products in the ecosystem, we have designed a new concept, the digital entreprener, which is based on a concept, idea, project, or people, structured with digital assets allowing financement, structuration, distribution, transparance, everything needed to accomplish goal set by the actual structure forming the digital entreprener. the musical muse works the same but the value is created by arts like musique etc and then shared / growth by the community 
5. we are constently looking for the best partner to growth our ecosystem, allowing anyone to contribute in the form they prefer. Soon we'll have 10 to 20 projects planed to be integrated. Some events will take place to connect and bring value to the community of all projects in the ecosystem
