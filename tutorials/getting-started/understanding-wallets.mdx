# Getting Started with Web3 Wallets
A Web3 wallet is your gateway to digital assets and decentralized applications like TokenFabric. Think of it as your digital identity and account combined - it's how you'll interact with blockchain networks.

## Types of Wallets on TokenFabric

### 1. Social Login Wallets (Recommended for Beginners)
The easiest way to get started with TokenFabric:
- Sign up with email
- Use Google account
- Connect other social accounts

**Benefits:**
- Quick setup (under 1 minute)
- Familiar login process
- Built-in security features
- Can be exported to other wallets later

### 2. External Wallets
For users who already have cryptocurrency wallets:
- MetaMask
- Coinbase Wallet
- WalletConnect (350+ compatible wallets)

**Benefits:**
- Use existing wallet
- Greater control
- Wide compatibility

<Note>
Not sure which to choose? Start with social login - you can always export your wallet later if needed.
</Note>

<Tips>
Social wallets maintain consistent addresses across our ecosystem protocols. This means if you create a wallet on TokenFabric and use the same social login on Zenvest, you'll have the same wallet address on both platforms.
