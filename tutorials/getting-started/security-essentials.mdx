# Web3 Security Fundamentals
Security is crucial in Web3. This guide covers the fundamental practices to keep your assets safe on TokenFabric and across the blockchain space.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Wallet Security
Your wallet is your bank account and identity combined - protect it accordingly.

**Never Share:**
- Recovery phrases
- Private keys
- Wallet passwords
- Screen shares showing sensitive info

**Always:**
- Use unique passwords
- Enable 2FA where available
- Lock your wallet when not in use
- Keep software updated

<Warning>
If someone gets your recovery phrase or private key, they can take all your assets. These should never be shared with anyone.
</Warning>

## Common Scams to Avoid

### 1. Phishing Attacks
Scammers try to steal your information through:
- Fake websites
- Impersonation
- Malicious links
- Suspicious emails

**Protection:**
- Bookmark official sites
- Type URLs directly
- Verify all addresses
- Don't click unknown links

### 2. Social Engineering
Be aware of:
- Fake support staff
- Urgent action requests
- Too-good-to-be-true offers
- Unsolicited messages

**Protection:**
- Use official channels only
- Take time to verify
