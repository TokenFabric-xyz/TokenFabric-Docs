# Transferring Digital Assets

Moving digital assets between wallets is a fundamental skill in Web3. This guide covers how to safely transfer tokens and NFTs while avoiding common mistakes.

## Before You Transfer

### Essential Checks
1. **Wallet Preparation**

   - Assets visible in wallet

2. **Address Verification**
   - Double-check recipient address
   - Verify network compatibility
   - Ensure asset support
   - Test with small amounts first

<Warning>
Transfers are irreversible. Always verify addresses carefully - wrong addresses mean permanent loss.
</Warning>
