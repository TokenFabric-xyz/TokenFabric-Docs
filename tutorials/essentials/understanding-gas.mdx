# Understanding Gas Fees

Gas fees are transaction costs paid to process operations on blockchain networks. Understanding them helps you save money and avoid failed transactions.

## What Are Gas Fees?

Think of gas like the processing fee for blockchain transactions:
- Required for all blockchain operations
- Paid in the network's native token
- Varies based on network congestion
- Different for each type of action

## Gas on Different Networks

### Base Network (Recommended)
TokenFabric recommends Base for most users:
- Lower gas costs ($0.01-0.05 per transaction)
- Fast processing
- Ethereum security
- Optimized for TokenFabric

### Ethereum Mainnet
- Higher security
- More expensive ($2-100+ per transaction)
- Better for high-value transactions
- Wider adoption

<Tip>
Start with Base Network if you're new. It offers the best balance of cost and functionality for most users.
</Tip>

## Understanding Gas Costs

### Common Operations
Approximate costs on Base Network:

1. **Basic Transfers**
   - Send tokens: $0.01-0.05
   - Approve contracts: $0.02-0.10
   - Cancel transactions: $0.01-0.03

2. **Token Operations**
   - Create token: $0.10-0.50
   - Swap tokens: $0.05-0.20
   - Bridge assets: $0.10-0.30

<Note>
Costs are estimates and can vary based on network conditions.
</Note>

## Optimizing Gas Costs

### Best Practices
1. **Timing**
   - Check network congestion
   - Use during quiet periods
   - Monitor gas trends
   - Batch transactions when possible

2. **Settings**
   - Understand priority levels
   - Set appropriate limits
   - Consider transaction speed
   - Use gas estimation tools

## Common Gas Issues

### Failed Transactions
Common causes and solutions:

1. **Insufficient Gas**
   - Set higher gas limit
   - Ensure enough network tokens
   - Check current gas prices
   - Use gas estimators

2. **Network Congestion**
   - Wait for lower fees
   - Adjust priority
   - Consider other networks
   - Batch transactions

<Warning>
Failed transactions still cost gas fees. Always ensure proper settings to avoid wasting funds.
</Warning>

## Gas Settings on TokenFabric

### Default Settings
TokenFabric optimizes gas settings automatically:
- Recommended gas limits
- Priority suggestions
- Network recommendations
- Fee estimations

### Manual Adjustments
When to adjust settings:
- High-priority transactions
- Complex operations
- Custom requirements
- Network congestion
