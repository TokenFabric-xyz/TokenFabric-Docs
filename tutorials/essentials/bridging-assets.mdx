# Bridging Networks

Bridging allows you to move your assets between different blockchain networks. This guide covers safe bridging practices using TokenFabric's recommended solutions.

## Understanding Bridges

### What is Bridging?
- Moving assets between networks
- Maintaining token value
- Cross-chain transactions
- Network interoperability

### When to Bridge
- Accessing different networks
- Lower transaction costs
- Specific platform access
- Portfolio diversification

## Recommended Bridges

### 1. Base Bridge (Official)
TokenFabric recommends the official Base Bridge:
- [bridge.base.org](https://bridge.base.org/deposit)
- Secure infrastructure
- Regular audits
- Official support

### 2. Coming Soon: TokenFabric Bridge
Native bridging powered by Chainlink CCIP:
- Seamless integration
- Enhanced security
- Optimized for TokenFabric assets
- Multi-network support

<Note>
While our native bridge is in development, use the official Base Bridge for safe transfers.

## How to Bridge Assets

### Using Base Bridge
1. **Preparation**
   - Connect wallet
   - Ensure sufficient funds
   - Check network fees
   - Verify token support

2. **Bridge Steps**
   - Select source network
   - Choose destination
   - Enter amount
   - Confirm transaction

<Warning>
Always verify bridge URLs carefully. Use only official links to avoid scams.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Research**
   - Verify bridge legitimacy
   - Check supported tokens
   - Understand timeframes
   - Review fees

2. **Security**
   - Use official bridges
   - Start with small amounts
   - Check network status
   - Verify addresses

### During Bridge
1. **Verification**

   - Varies by network
   - Usually 10-30 minutes
   - Can be longer
   - Network dependent

2. **Fees**
   - Source network gas
   - Bridge fees
   - Destination gas
   - Processing fees
