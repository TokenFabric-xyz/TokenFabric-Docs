# Understanding Bonding Curves

Bonding curves are automated market makers that determine token prices based on supply and demand. TokenFabric offers several curve types to suit different project needs.

## What is a Bonding Curve?

### Basic Concept
A bonding curve is a mathematical formula that:
- Automatically sets token prices
- Manages buy/sell operations
- Creates predictable pricing
- Ensures constant liquidity

### How It Works
1. **Price Calculation**
   - Based on current supply
   - Adjusts automatically
   - Transparent mechanism
   - Continuous liquidity

2. **Key Benefits**
   - Always liquid
   - Predictable pricing
   - No order books
   - Instant trades

## TokenFabric Curve Types

### 1. Linear Curve
```math
Price = m Supply + b
```
**Best for:**
- Steady growth
- Predictable pricing
- Simple tokenomics
- New projects

**Characteristics:**
- Constant price increase
- Easy to understand
- Lower volatility
- Stable growth

### 2. Exponential Curve
```math
Price = a e^(bSupply)
```
**Best for:**
- Scarcity-driven tokens
- Reward systems
- Collector items
- High-growth projects

**Characteristics:**
- Accelerating price growth
- Early adopter benefits
- Higher potential returns
- More volatility

### 3. Logarithmic Curve
```math
Price = a ln(Supply + 1) + b
```
**Best for:**
- Utility tokens
- Large supply tokens
- Stable projects
- Community currencies

**Characteristics:**
- Diminishing price growth
- More stable long-term
- Controlled appreciation
- Lower volatility

<Note>
Choose your curve type carefully - it cannot be changed after token creation.

## Choosing Your Curve

### Factors to Consider
1. **Project Goals**
   - Growth expectations
   - Target audience
   - Token utility
   - Market strategy

2. **Economic Model**
   - Supply dynamics
   - Price targets
   - Distribution plan
   - Investment timeline

### Use Case Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Community Token">
    Recommended: Linear or Logarithmic
    - Stable growth
    - Fair distribution
    - Predictable pricing
    - Community friendly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Collector Items">
    Recommended: Exponential
    - Scarcity value
    - Early adoption rewards
    - Price appreciation
    - Exclusivity
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Utility Token">
    Recommended: Logarithmic
    - Controlled growth
    - Sustainable pricing
    - Wide accessibility
    - Long-term stability
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Curve Parameters

### Key Settings
1. **Initial Price**
   - Starting point
   - Entry barrier
   - Market positioning
   - Growth potential

2. **Curve Steepness**
   - Price sensitivity
   - Growth rate
   - Market dynamics
   - Risk level

### Parameter Impact

#### Linear Curve
- Slope affects price growth rate
- Higher slope = faster price increase
- Lower slope = more stable pricing
- Consider market size

#### Exponential Curve
- Base affects growth acceleration
- Higher base = steeper growth
- Lower base = gentler curve
- Plan carefully

#### Logarithmic Curve
- Coefficient affects curve shape
- Higher = more initial growth
- Lower = more gradual growth
- Balance accessibility

## Best Practices

### Testing Strategy
1. **Parameter Testing**
   - Use test transactions
   - Simulate scenarios
   - Check price impacts
   - Verify mechanics

2. **Market Analysis**
   - Study similar projects
   - Analyze market size
   - Consider competition
   - Project growth

### Risk Management
1. **Price Protection**
   - Set appropriate limits
   - Plan for volatility
   - Monitor activity
   - Adjust parameters

2. **Supply Control**
   - Manage initial distribution
   - Plan token releases
   - Consider burning
   - Monitor circulation
