# Bonding Curve Trading

## What is a Bonding Curve?

A bonding curve is an automated market maker (AMM) mechanism that defines a mathematical relationship between a token's price and its supply. This relationship is typically represented by a curve, where the token price increases as the supply increases, and vice versa.

## How Bonding Curves Work

1. **Automated Pricing**: The price of tokens is determined automatically based on the current supply.
2. **Continuous Liquidity**: Tokens can be bought or sold at any time, with the price adjusting instantly.
3. **Predictable Pricing**: The price change follows a predefined mathematical formula.

## Advantages of Bonding Curve Trading

Compared to traditional trading systems, bonding curves offer several benefits:

- **Instant Liquidity**: No need for order books or matching buyers and sellers.
- **Transparency**: The pricing mechanism is open and predictable.
- **Incentivized Participation**: Early adopters are often rewarded as the token value increases.
- **Customizable Economics**: Different curve models can be chosen to suit various project needs.

## Bonding Curve Models in TokenFabric

TokenFabric offers several bonding curve models, each with unique characteristics:

### 1. Linear Model
- **Description**: Price increases at a constant rate as supply grows.
- **Best for**: Projects seeking a steady, predictable price progression.
- **Effect on Tokenomics**: Provides a balanced incentive structure for both early and late investors.

### 2. Exponential Model
- **Description**: Price increases more rapidly as supply grows.
- **Best for**: Projects aiming to incentivize early adoption strongly.
- **Effect on Tokenomics**: Creates a strong incentive for early investors, potentially easing early-stage funding.

### 3. Flat Model
- **Description**: Price remains constant regardless of supply.
- **Best for**: Stablecoins or projects requiring price stability.
- **Effect on Tokenomics**: Maintains a consistent token value, suitable for utility tokens or payment systems.

### 4. Logarithmic Model
- **Description**: Price increases rapidly at first, then slows down as supply grows.
- **Best for**: Projects seeking to balance early adoption incentives with long-term stability.
- **Effect on Tokenomics**: Provides strong early incentives while moderating price growth in later stages.

## Customizing Your Bonding Curve

TokenFabric allows builders to customize their bonding curve by defining:

- Initial token price
- Final token price (or maximum price)
- Total token supply

These parameters can be adjusted to fine-tune the tokenomics for your specific project needs. Additionally, TokenFabric offers the flexibility to provide custom supply/pricing schemas for unique use cases.

## Use Cases for Bonding Curves

Bonding curves can be applied to various projects, including:

- Gaming tokens: Reward early players while maintaining long-term engagement.
- DAO governance tokens: Incentivize early participation in decentralized organizations.
- Artist tokens: Allow creators to monetize their work with fan-driven value appreciation.
- Fundraising: Provide a transparent and fair mechanism for project funding.

## Considerations for Builders

When choosing and designing your bonding curve, consider the following:

1. **Token Utility**: Ensure your token has a clear use case that aligns with its price dynamics.
2. **Community Expectations**: Communicate the chosen model clearly to set appropriate expectations.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Consider potential regulatory implications of your token's price mechanics.
4. **Long-term Sustainability**: Design your curve with the project's long-term goals in mind.
5. **Market Conditions**: Factor in how external market conditions might interact with your chosen curve.

By carefully considering these factors and leveraging TokenFabric's customizable bonding curve options, you can create a tokenomic model that best suits your project's needs and goals.
