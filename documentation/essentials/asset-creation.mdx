# Digital Asset Creation with TokenFabric

TokenFabric empowers users to create and manage digital assets without any coding knowledge. This guide will help you understand the purpose of digital assets, the differences between ERC20 tokens and ERC1155 NFTs, and how to choose the right asset type for your project.

## Understanding Digital Assets

Digital assets are programmable tokens that represent value, ownership, or rights on the blockchain. They can be used for various purposes, including:

- Representing ownership in a project or company
- Creating loyalty programs or reward systems
- Facilitating decentralized finance (DeFi) applications
- Tokenizing real-world assets
- Enabling community governance

TokenFabric simplifies the creation of these assets, allowing anyone to bring their ideas to life on the blockchain.

## ERC20 vs ERC1155: Choosing the Right Standard

TokenFabric supports two main token standards: ERC20 and ERC1155. Understanding the differences between these standards is crucial for selecting the right one for your project.

### ERC20 Tokens

ERC20 is the most widely used token standard for fungible tokens. These tokens are interchangeable and divisible, making them ideal for:

- Cryptocurrencies
- Utility tokens
- Governance tokens
- Tokenized assets

**Benefits of ERC20:**
- High compatibility with existing wallets and exchanges
- Easily tradable and liquid
- Well-suited for representing financial assets

**Real-world example:** The Zenvest project uses an ERC20 token created on TokenFabric to generate revenue and provide governance rights in a decentralized, community-owned platform.

### ERC1155 NFTs

ERC1155 is a more flexible standard that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This standard is ideal for:

- Gaming assets
- Digital collectibles
- Membership passes
- Multi-token ecosystems

**Benefits of ERC1155:**
- Efficient batch transfers
- Ability to create both fungible and non-fungible tokens under one contract
- Reduced gas costs for multiple token operations

**Use case:** An artist could create a limited edition collection of digital artworks as ERC1155 tokens, each with its own unique properties and rarity.
