## Introduction to TokenFabric's Tokenomics

TokenFabric empowers creators to design sophisticated and flexible tokenomics models without requiring deep technical knowledge. Our platform offers a range of customizable options to tailor your token's economic structure to your project's specific needs.

## Key Tokenomics Features

### Flexible Supply Allocation

- **Free Minting**: Allocate tokens for team members, project development, marketing, or DEX listings.
- **Bonding Curve Allocation**: Distribute part or all of the supply through an automated market maker.

### Bonding Curve Models

Choose from various bonding curve models to define your token's price dynamics:

- Linear
- Exponential
- Flat
- Logarithmic

Each model impacts how your token's price changes as the supply increases or decreases.

### Customizable Royalties

Set up royalties to generate income and incentivize specific behaviors:

- Define buy and sell royalties (immutable once set)
- Split royalties between two receiver addresses
- Adjust the percentage split between receivers

### Royalty Utilization Strategies

Direct royalties to various purposes:

- Burn address to increase token value
- DAO treasury to empower community governance
- Project wallet for ongoing development and growth

### Supply and Pricing Parameters

- Set a maximum supply for your token
- Define the initial and final minting prices for the bonding curve
- Determine the free minting supply (tokens not backed by the bonding curve)

### Token Allocation and Locking

- Create locks to allocate token supply for specific purposes (e.g., team, marketing)
- Design vesting schedules to align long-term incentives

## Designing Your Tokenomics

When creating your token's economic model, consider the following:

1. **Project Goals**: Align your tokenomics with your project's objectives and vision.
2. **Community Incentives**: Design mechanisms that encourage community participation and growth.
3. **Long-term Sustainability**: Plan for future developments, including DEX listings and potential partnerships.
4. **Transparency**: Clearly communicate your tokenomics model to build trust with your community.

## Best Practices

- Carefully design your price curve to ensure sustainable growth
- Reserve a portion of the supply for future developments (e.g., DEX liquidity)
- Create a clear and comprehensive explanation of your tokenomics for your community
- Regularly review and adjust your tokenomics strategy (within the immutable parameters) as your project evolves
