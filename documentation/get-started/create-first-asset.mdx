# Create Your First Asset on TokenFabric

Welcome to TokenFabric! This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first digital asset. Whether you're launching a new token for your project or minting NFTs, TokenFabric makes it easy to bring your vision to life.

## Prerequisites

Good news! There are no specific prerequisites to start creating your asset on TokenFabric. If you don't have a wallet, you can easily create one with our social login feature using your email or Google account. This wallet can be exported at any time, giving you full control over your assets.

## Step-by-Step Asset Creation

### Step 1: Define Your Asset's Purpose and Form

Before diving into the technical details, it's crucial to have a clear vision for your asset:

- Determine the purpose and utility of your token
- Decide between ERC20 (fungible tokens) or ERC1155 (non-fungible tokens)
- Consider your target audience and use cases

<Tip>
Research similar tokens in your category to understand best practices in tokenomics, fees, and community engagement.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Set Basic Token Information

- Choose a unique and memorable name for your token
- Define a symbol (ticker) for your token
- Select the network for token emission (e.g., Ethereum, Base)

### Step 3: Configure Royalties

Royalties allow you to capture value from token transactions:

- Set buy and sell royalty percentages
- Specify up to two receiver addresses for royalties
- Define the split percentage between these addresses

<Note>
Carefully consider your royalty structure as it can impact token adoption and trading behavior.
</Note>

### Step 4: Select a Bonding Curve Model

Choose a bonding curve model that aligns with your tokenomics:

- Linear
- Exponential
- Logarithmic
- Flat
- Custom (for advanced users)

Each model affects how your token's price changes as the supply increases or decreases.

### Step 5: Define Token Supply and Pricing

- Set the maximum supply for your token
- Determine the amount for free minting (if any)
- Set the initial price and final price for your token

These parameters will shape your token's economic model and distribution strategy.

### Step 6: Launch Your Asset

With all parameters set, you're ready to launch! Click the "Create Asset" button to deploy your token. Once launched, you can immediately:

- Trade your token
- Lock tokens for vesting or time-based release
- Transfer tokens to team members or early supporters

## Best Practices for New Asset Creators

1. **Research Thoroughly**: Look at successful projects in your niche for inspiration on tokenomics and community building.

2. **Start Small**: Consider launching with a limited supply or on a testnet to gather feedback before a full-scale launch.

3. **Engage Your Community**: Clearly communicate your token's utility and value proposition to potential holders.

4. **Plan for the Long Term**: Design your tokenomics with sustainable growth in mind, not just short-term gains.

5. **Stay Compliant**: Ensure your token and its intended use align with relevant regulations in your jurisdiction.
